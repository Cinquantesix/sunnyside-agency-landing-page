## My process

I tried to focus on the mobile-first and developp desktop after. I think it's really challenging because you need to know how each part of the design will fit in a bigger screen. Like chest, you need to have some step ahead. I think I miss that part for now. But when the mobile code is set, the desktop code is really quick to set-up and it's really cool to lose less time on this part!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Doing a bigger project with content that influence others
- Use SCSS in a better way
- Importance of 7:1 (I don't use in the projet and I regret it…)
- Use less HTML and more CSS
### Continued development

Next time I will:

- Maybe use 7:1, I think bigger project need to be more clear
- Begin to add comment in my code (seriously…)
- Find a way to declare BEM with good terms
- Develop more each part one after all with all style (mobile + desktop) and less all the site in mobile and after in desktop
- Find a better way to have smooth content between screen size
